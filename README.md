This repo exists to centralize RPI Ambulance's GitHub issue labels. They can be reused in other repos using one of many label sync tools.

If you're adding a label to another repo that you think should be organization-wide, please [add it to this repo](https://github.com/rpiambulance/issue-labels/issues/labels), as well.
